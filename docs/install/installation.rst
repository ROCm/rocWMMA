Install rocWMMA
***************

Before you begin, verify that your system is supported. For more information,
see the :doc:`ROCm compatibility matrix
<rocm:compatibility/compatibility-matrix>`.

For advanced workflows, source builds, or custom configurations, see
:doc:`./source-build`.

Install the ROCm Core SDK
=========================

rocWMMA is included with the ROCm Core SDK on Linux. For the most complete
installation, we recommend that developers use the ``amdrocm-core-sdk`` meta
package.

For instructions, see :doc:`Install AMD ROCm <rocm:install/rocm>`. Use the
selector panel on that page to view instructions appropriate for your system
environment.

Install common math libraries on Linux
======================================

Alternatively, if you want to install rocWMMA as part of the ROCm common math
libraries package (a subset of the ROCm Core SDK ``amdrocm-core-sdk``) without
additional ROCm libraries and tools, install the ``amdrocm-math-common``
package. This includes the ROCm runtime and system dependencies.

1. Complete the :doc:`ROCm installation prerequisites <rocm:install/rocm>` to
   install dependencies and configure GPU access permissions.

2. Install the ROCm common math libraries package that matches your desired ROCm version.
   Package names use the following format:

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      amdrocm-math-common<rocm_version>

   ``<rocm_version>`` represents the ROCm Core SDK version to install. Omit this
   suffix to install the latest available version.

   For example, to install the latest ROCm common math libraries release for
   supported GPU architectures:

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Debian-based distros

         .. code-block:: bash

            sudo apt install amdrocm-math-common

      .. tab-item:: RHEL-based distros

         .. code-block:: bash

            sudo dnf install amdrocm-math-common

      .. tab-item:: SLES

         .. code-block:: bash

            sudo zypper install amdrocm-math-common

Install a nightly build
=======================

The `TheRock <https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock>`__ build system also publishes
nightly builds for the ROCm Core SDK and its components, including rocWMMA.
See `Nightly release status
<https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock#nightly-release-status>`__ for details.
