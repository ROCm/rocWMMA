## Acceptance Criteria ##

The goal of rocWMMA is to provide a C++ API for accelerating matrix multiply accumulate (MMA) operations utilizing AMD GPU hardware.
Contributors that wish to help optimize and expand the capabilities of rocWMMA in furtherance of this goal should adhere to the following
guidelines for all features and fixes. Detailed coding style and pull request guidelines are covered later sections.

Contributors wishing to submit new features for rocWMMA should follow the guidelines outlined below:

- Performance Improvements
    * Features targeting performance improvements for any aspect of rocWMMA are generally permitted. Any optimizations must be both notable
      and repeatable in order to avoid unnecessary code maintenance. Documentation regarding performance improvements such as benchmark test
      comparisons must also be provided.
- Bug Fixes
    * Any observed unintended behavior within the rocWMMA library should first be documented by filing a bug report issue using the above
      template. Non-critical issues may be deferred until future releases.
- WMMA Porting
    * Developers wishing to implement gap closures with nvcuda::wmma may suggest additional features to do so

All new features and fixes should also tie into the rocWMMA [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ROCm/rocWMMA/issues) tab:

- **Enhancements**
    + Any implementations of pre-filed enhancement requests should clearly link to the original issue.
    + Any new enhancements should be documented as if filing a new enhancement request using the template above.
- **Bug Fixes**
    + Any fixes for pre-filed issues should clearly link to the original issue.
    + Any newly found issues should be documented as if filing a new issue using the template above.

### Exceptions ###

Exceptions to these criteria will be handled on a case-by-case basis, and should be discussed via the Issues tab.

## Code Structure ##

The organization of the rocWMMA library is explained in detail in the [Programmers Guide](https://github.com/ROCm/rocWMMA/blob/develop/docs/Programmers_Guide.rst)

## Coding Style ##

This project follows the [CPP Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md)
with few modifications or additions noted below. All pull-requests should in good faith attempt to follow the guidelines stated therein,
but we recognize that the content is lengthy. Below we list our primary concerns when reviewing pull-requests.

### Interface ###

- Library code should use C++17.
- Our minimum supported compiler is hipcc 4.4.
- Avoid CamelCase.
    * This rule applies specifically to publicly visible APIs, but is also encouraged (not mandated) for internal code

### Philosophy ###

-  [P.2](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rp-Cplusplus)
   Write in ISO Standard C++14 (especially to support Windows, Linux and
   MacOS platforms)
-  [P.5](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rp-compile-time)
   Prefer compile-time checking to run-time checking

### Implementation ###

-  [SF.1](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rs-file-suffix)
   Use a ``.cpp`` suffix for code files and an ``.hpp`` suffix for
   interface files if your project doesn't already follow another
   convention
-  [SF.5](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rs-consistency)
   A ``.cpp`` file must include the ``.hpp`` file(s) that defines its
   interface
-  [SF.7](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rs-using-directive)
   Don't put a global ``using``-directive in a header file
-  [SF.8](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rs-guards)
   Use ``#include`` guards for all ``.hpp`` files
-  [SF.21](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rs-unnamed)
   Don't use an unnamed (anonymous) ``namespace`` in a header
-  [SL.10](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rsl-arrays)
   Prefer using ``std::array`` or ``std::vector`` instead of a C array
-  [C.9](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rc-private)
   Minimize the exposure of class members
-  [F.3](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rf-single)
   Keep functions short and simple
-  [F.21](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rf-out-multi)
   To return multiple 'out' values, prefer returning a ``std::tuple``
-  [R.1](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rr-raii)
   Manage resources automatically using RAII (this includes
   ``std::unique_ptr`` & ``std::shared_ptr``)
-  [ES.11](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Res-auto)
   Use ``auto`` to avoid redundant repetition of type names
-  [ES.20](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Res-always)
   Always initialize an object
-  [ES.23](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Res-list)
   Prefer the ``{}`` initializer syntax
-  [CP.1](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#S-concurrency)
   Assume that your code will run as part of a multi-threaded program
-  [I.2](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Ri-global)
   Avoid global variables

## Pull Request Guidelines ##
Our code contribution guidelines closely follows the model of [GitHub Pull-Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
The rocWMMA repository follows a workflow which dictates a ``/master`` branch where releases are cut, and a ``/develop`` branch which serves as
an integration branch for new code.

No changes are allowed to be directly committed to the develop branch of the rocWMMA repository. All authors are required to develop their
change sets on a separate branch and then create a pull request to merge their changes into the develop branch. When you create a pull
request, you should target the **develop** branch for integration.

The typical workflow for creating a rocWMMA pull request is as follows:

1. Create and track a rocWMMA fork.
2. Clone your fork:

    ```bash
    git clone -b develop https://github.com/<your_fork>/rocWMMA.git .
    .githooks/install
    git checkout -b <new_branch>
    ...
    git add <new_work>
    git commit -m "What was changed"
    git push origin <new_branch>
    ...
    ```

3. Create a pull request to the ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocWMMA develop branch.
4. Await CI and approval feedback.
5. Once approved, merge.

**Note**
You must install GitHooks because there are triggers for Clang formatting in commits. Instructions for formatting
rocWMMA are included in [Formatting](#formatting).

### Deliverables ###

rocWMMA has a set of required deliverables for every pull request that are as follows.

1. **Test Integration**:
    - All new functionality introduced to rocWMMA must be accompanied by unit tests. Unit tests should integrate within the existing
    googletest framework and must have good code coverage. Existing unit tests should be used as a guide and are found in ``test/unit``.

    - New features that aim to optimize rocWMMA must have benchmark and validation tests, and performance must approach the compute bound limit or
    memory bound limit. These tests should follow the same googletest framework laid out in the rocWMMA GEMM tests found in ``test/gemm``.
    Features that impact the performance of existing rocWMMA kernels must be accompanied with a performance analysis against the pre-existing
    kernels.

2. **API Documentation**:
    - Any new outward facing rocWMMA API functions must be properly documented and included in the [API Reference Guide](https://github.com/ROCm/rocWMMA/blob/develop/docs/API_Reference_Guide.rst).

3. **Type Support**:
    - All features introduced to rocWMMA must maintain support for the following types:
        - **Supported Datatypes (gfx9)**
            - Native Data Types: int8, f16, f32, f64*
            - Non-Native Data Types: h16, bf16

        - **Supported Datatypes (gfx11)**
            - Native Data Types: int8, f16
            - Non-Native Data Types: h16, bf16

        (*only on gfx90a, gfx940, gfx941 & gfx942)

    - Support for the other rocWMMA fragment parameters as described in ``library/include/rocwmma/rocwmma.hpp`` must also be maintained.

4. **Licensing**:
    - All code submitted to rocWMMA must be original, no AI generated code.
    - The code you are contributing is your own, and you have the right to license it.
    - No code found under other licenses is permitted.
    - Any submitted code will subsequently be covered under the MIT License.
    - For each new file introduced in your pull request, please include the licensing header:

### Process ###

Reviewers for rocWMMA pull requests are listed under ``.github/CODEOWNERS``. Pull requests should be properly documented with comments
and linked to their corresponding issues. Pull request reviews should include insightful comments where changes are requested.

#### Formatting ####

rocWMMA C++ code is formatted using ``clang-format``.
- To manually format using clang-format use the version in the
  ``/opt/rocm/llvm/bin`` directory. Please do not use your system's built-in ``clang-format``, as this may be an older
  version that will result in different results.

  To format a file, use:

  ```
  /opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang-format -style=file -i <path-to-source-file>
  ```


  To format all files, run the following script in rocWMMA directory:

  ```
  #!/bin/bash
  git ls-files -z *.cc *.cpp *.h *.hpp *.cl *.h.in *.hpp.in *.cpp.in | xargs -0 /opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang-format -style=file -i
  ```

- Alternatively, githooks can be installed to format the code per-commit:

  ```
  ./.githooks/install
  ```
