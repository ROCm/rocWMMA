/**
 * ROCWMMACoop complements the ROCWMMA API with support for cooperative operations.
 * Operations may be split into smaller unit work items that are assigned to waves
 * in a collaborative pool using a round-robin fashion.
 *
 * From each wave's perspective, their data responsibility determines the cohesiveness
 * of the data in wave's fragment. Cooperative operations are designed to be used
 * in conjunction with each other to cooperatively move data from a single full fragment,
 * as is common to do in GEMM algorithms. This API facilitates this functionality.
 *
 * \n
 * **load_matrix_coop_sync / store_matrix_coop_sync**
 *
 * Loads data from memory according to Matrix Layout.
 * Matrix A layout loads / stores matrix columns in the K direction
 * (Matrix A = M x K, fragA = BlockM x BlockK)
 * Matrix B layout loads / stores matrix rows in the K direction
 * (Matrix B = K x N, fragB = BlockK x BlockN)
 * Matrix C layout loads / stores matrix rows in vector width of 4
 * (Matrix C = M x N, fragAcc = BlockM x BlockN)
 *
 * Fragments are stored in packed registers in optimal load / store patterns.
 * In-register elements have no guaranteed order, which have been optimized for loading / storing efficiency.
